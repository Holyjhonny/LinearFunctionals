# A vector space is a set V that is closed
# under finite vector addition and
# scalar multiplication, meaning: Let X,Y,Z belong to V and
# let r, s belong to R or C then the following must hold

# X + Y = Y + X                  CommutativitY
# ( X + Y ) + Z = X + ( Y + Z )  AssosiativitY
# 0 + X = X + 0 = = X            AdditivitY identitY
# X + ( - X ) = 0                Existense of inverse additivitY
# r ( s X ) = ( r s ) X          AssosiativitY for scalar
# ( r + s ) X = r X + s X        Distribution of scalar sums
#  r ( X + Y) = r x + r Y        Distribution of vector sums
# I X = X                        Scalar multiplication identity
