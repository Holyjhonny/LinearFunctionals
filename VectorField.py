# A vector field is a set V that is closed
# under finite vector addition and
# scalar multiplication, meaning: Let x,y,z belong to V and
# let r, s belong to R or C then the following must hold

# x + y = y + x                  Commutativity
# ( x + y ) + z = x + ( y + z )  Assosiativity
# 0 + x = x + 0 = = x            Additivity identity
# x + ( - x ) = 0                Existense of inverse additivity
# r ( s x ) = ( r s ) x          Assosiativity for scalar
# ( r + s ) x = r x + s x        Distribution of scalar sums
